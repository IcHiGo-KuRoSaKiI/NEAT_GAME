## About NEAT Algorithm
NEAT stands for NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies. It is a method for evolving artificial neural networks with a genetic algorithm. NEAT implements the idea that it is most effective to start evolution with small, simple networks and allow them to become increasingly complex over generations
